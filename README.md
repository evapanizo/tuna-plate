# King Broccoli

> Tuna-Plate 2018 - Internal Ironhack Barcelona Hackathon (UX/UI + WebDev)

## Description
Did you know that Spain is the largest producer of broccoli in the world but 88% of it is exported?

However, consuming local products brings incredible benefits! First of all, products are fresher! Pollution and waste as a consequence of food transportation and refrigeration are reduced too.

This project aims at creating a lead generation landing page that promotes consuming local broccoli by getting the users to subscribe to a broccoli recipe newsletter, that will help them cook easier and tastier recipes using local broccoli!

## MVP
The MVP consists of building an html structure with the following parts: 

> ### Header
>  Fixed navigation bar to allow the user to visualise the subscription button as he scrolls through the page. 
>  ### Body
>   #### Section 1
>   This section includes the company logo, the title and the introduction to the landing page. 
>   #### Section 2
>  This section includes a video recipe and the input and buttons to subscribe. 
>   #### Section 3
>   This sections includes the benefits of local broccoli consumption. 
>   #### Section 4
>   This sections includes the health benefits of broccoli consumption. 
>  ### Footer
>  The footer includes the list of trust indicators. 

The MVP also includes giving styles to the html structure according to the designed HI-FI wireframes.
